# BITSHackathon

Idea: Community-Based Incident Detection and Verification (Powered by AI, of course, lol)


## AI ASSISTED NOTES:
High Impact: Early fire/smoke/accident detection is lifesaving, especially in dry or remote areas.
Multi-source Verification: Using both crowdsourcing and news scraping gives it credibility.
Scalable: You can simulate detection with static images or mock alerts, making it hackathon-feasible.
Smart Design Thinking: You’re considering not just detection but trust and confirmation — that’s mature product thinking.
