Idea: Community-Based Incident Detection and Verification (Powered by AI, of course, lol)


## NOTES:
High Impact: Early fire/smoke/accident detection is lifesaving, especially in dry or remote areas.
Multi-source Verification: Using both crowdsourcing and news scraping gives it credibility.

## Features
- Report and confirm incidents on a live map
- Real-time status updates and visual marker levels
- Undo your report or confirm others'

## Dependencies to install in order to run
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
